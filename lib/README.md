We should see if this is an ideal setup before fully commiting

Preliminary docs:
Sharing a lib/ folder in STM32CubeIDE

You're right that it's the sensitive part. The thing that breaks it is absolute paths: if the project file says C:/Users/faysal/..., it builds on your machine and nowhere else. Done with a relative path, it works for anyone who clones the repo.

Layout:

repo/
├── lib/
│   └── sam_m8q/  sam_m8q.c, sam_m8q.h
├── firmware/      (CubeIDE project)
└── bringup/gps-sam-m8q/   (CubeIDE project)

In each project that uses it:

Add the source as a linked folder. Right-click the project > New > Folder > Advanced > "Link to alternate location", and enter PARENT-1-PROJECT_LOC/lib (for bringup/... it's PARENT-2-PROJECT_LOC/lib). PROJECT_LOC is the project's own folder and PARENT-1- means one level up, so the link is stored relative to the project.
Add the include path. Project Properties > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols > Includes > GNU C, add ${ProjectDirPath}/../lib (or ../../lib for bring-up projects). Do it for both Debug and Release configurations.
Check the result. Open .project in a text editor; the <linkedResources> entry should contain PARENT-1-PROJECT_LOC, not a drive letter. Then have your team lead clone and build it once.

Code then does #include "sam_m8q/sam_m8q.h".

One rule for code in lib/: it shouldn't include main.h or depend on one project's pin names. Pass in the handle it needs (UART_HandleTypeDef *, I2C_HandleTypeDef *) at init. That's what lets the same driver run in the bring-up project and the main firmware.
